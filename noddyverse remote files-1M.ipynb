    "For each model the magnetic response, the gravity response, the top surface, the north facing vertical section (looking from the south) and the west-facing vertical section (looking from the west) of the 4 x 4 x 4 km cube are displayed: \n",

Windows software to read this history file is available at the <a href=\"http://tectonique.net/noddy\">Noddy Site</a>, and the source code for a command line version of Noddy, as well as this notebook, is available from <a href=\"https://github.com/Loop3D/noddyverse\">github</a> The 1M models themselves are stored at  <a href=\"https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/OUe6J9iWW1SnKjw\">Cloudstor</a> as individual files and as 343 tar files, one per history sequence frokm <a href=\"https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/UxnVSkHfnr7chW9\">here</a>.\n",

    "To use this notebook modify the parameters in the first cell and then both cells, with all outputs displayed at the bottom of the notebook. The code in <a href=\"./noddyverse.py\" taget=\"_blank\">noddyverse.py</a> provides an example so users can see how to parse the individual files. \n",
